### Nvim-R

This is the development code of Nvim-R.

If you do not use a plugin manager, you should clone this directory and adjust
[Neovim]'s **runtimepath** in your **~/.nvimrc** as in the example below:

    set runtimepath=~/Nvim-R,~/.nvim,$VIMRUNTIME,~/.nvim/after

If you use a plugin manager, such as [vim-plug], [Vundle] or [Pathogen],
follow its instructions.

Stable versions of this plugin are released at
[http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/NvimR.html](http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/NvimR.html).

Please, read the file *doc/Nvim-R.txt* for usage details.

If you use this version, you will also need the development version of
[nvimcom].
